Converters Documentation
===================================

**Converters** provides a small in-python DSL / declarative mechanism to define Converter classes that perform a particular transformation of some python object into another one, allowing you to rename, alter, add, clean etc. fields of objects / maps conveniently, making it easy to work with nested structures and a host of other common cases.

.. note::

   This project is still version 0 and under active development. The API is not fully nailed down yet and so things may change in a back-incomp=atible way before the release of version 1.0.
